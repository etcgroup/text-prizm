# Extended API Summary Info Module

The summary info portion of the extended API provides general descriptive information about each of the resources. Many of the calls provide histogram data about the messages or the instances of codes, and thus return sets of counts. 



## Codes

### Instances over time `GET /ext/summary_info/codes/applied_counts`

Retrieves binned code instance counts over the range [`time_start`,`time_end`] with `bin_count` bins for code `code_id`.

Time in this case is time the instance was applied.


Parameters:
* **`code_id`: a code id (required)**
* `time_start`: starting time -- unixtime (defaults to 0) 
* `time_end`: ending time -- unixtime (defaults to maxint)
